For the *range minimum query* (RMQ) problem, we are given an array $A$ of size $n$ and two indices $i$ and $j$ with $0 \leq i \leq j < n$.
We then want to determine the smallest element in $\bigl \lbrace A[i], A[i + 1], \ldots, A[j] \bigr \rbrace$.
The program implements different RMQ algorithms.
They are mostly taken from [1].

The algorithms all have two parts to it: a pre-processing and query.
The pre-processing processes the given array *A* and then stores results that allow for a faster query.
The query then determines the minimum in the specified rang with the help of the pre-processing results.
Subsequently, these algorithms have two runtimes.
We write that the runtime of an algorithm is in $\bigl \langle \mathcal{O} \bigl( f(n) \bigr), \mathcal{O} \bigl( g(n) \bigr) \bigr \rangle$ time if the pre-processing runs in $\mathcal{O} \bigl( f(n) \bigr)$ time, and a single query runs in $\mathcal{O} \bigl( g(n) \bigr)$ time.


# Implemented Algorithms

  * **No Pre-Processing.**
    As the name suggests, this algorithm does not do any pre-processing at all.
    Subsequently, it iterate over the requested range of $A$ in each query.
    Runtime: $\bigl \langle \mathcal{O}(0), \mathcal{O}(j - i) \bigr \rangle$.

  * **Naive.**
    This is a straight forward implementation of an RMQ algorithm.
    It computes all $n^2$ possible results and stores them in a table $T$.
    A query then simply reads the value out of $T[i][j]$.
    Runtime: $\bigl \langle \mathcal{O} \bigl( n^2 \bigr), \mathcal{O}(1) \bigr \rangle$.

  * **Segment Tree.**
    This algorithms builds a full binary tree on top of $A$ which has the elements of $A$ as leaves.
    Each node $u$ then stores the minimum of all leaves that have $u$ as ancestor.
    Such a tree is called [Segment Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree).
    It allows to run queries in logarithmic time by searching for $i$ and $j$ in the tree.
    Runtime: $\bigl \langle \mathcal{O}(n), \mathcal{O}(\log n) \bigr \rangle$.

  * **Cache-Oblivious Segment Tree.**
    This algorithm works overall the same way as the Segment Tree algorithm above.
    The difference, however, is the way the nodes are stored in memory.
    They follow a *van Emde Boas layout* as described in [2, 3].
    Although the overall runtime is the same (asymptotically), there are asymptotically fewer cache misses when accessing nodes, leading to an overall better performance.
    Runtime: $\bigl \langle \mathcal{O}(n), \mathcal{O}(\log n) \bigr \rangle$.

  * **Sparse Table.**
    This algorithm is similar to the naive implementation in the sense that it computes a lookup table.
    That table, however, is much smaller.
    It only stores $\log n$ many rows, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ total memory usage.
    At the same time, it still allows to perform a query in constant time (although with non-trivial operations).
    Runtime: $\bigl\langle \mathcal{O}(n \log n), \mathcal{O}(1) \bigr\rangle$.

  * **±1 RMQ.**
    Consider an [Euler tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_tour_technique) over a tree where we store the height of each node whenever we encounter it.
    In the resulting sequence, subsequent elements differ by either +1 or -1.
    That is called the *±1 restriction*, and the goal of this algorithm is to make use of that restriction.
    The overall approach is similar to the Sparse Table.
    However, the given array $A$ is first split into small blocks of size $(\log n) / 2$.
    Given that small size and the strong restrictions for the input, there are only $\sqrt{n}$ different blocks possible.
    These properties allow the following overall runtime: $\bigl\langle \mathcal{O}(n), \mathcal{O}(1) \bigr\rangle$.


# Lowest Common Ancestor

We also implemented an algorithm that computes the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree.
The algorithm uses an Euler tour of the given tree and then performs a RMQ on that tour as described in [1].
For that it can use any of the RMQ algorithms described above.


# Rust Implementation

The original implementation was in C++.
I also started a reimplementation in Rust which can be found in the [RMQ.rs](https://github.com/ALeitert/RMQ.rs) repository.
